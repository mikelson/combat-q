======================== SUMMARY ========================

This program keeps track of when characters act in a d20 System or Dungeons and Dragons combat. It also keeps track of when spells expire. It is for use on palmtops running Palm OS version 2.0 or later.

======================== INSTALLATION ========================

- Download the file CombatQ.zip or CombatQ_trial.zip to a desktop computer.

- Unzip the file contents (CombatQ.prc or CombatQ_trial.prc, CombatQOGC.cpp, CombatQOGC.h, and CombatQHelp.txt) into a directory on the desktop computer.

- Add the file CombatQ.prc or CombatQ_trial.prc to the Palm Install Tool application on the desktop computer. On Windows computers with Install Tool, you can do this by double clicking on CombatQ.prc or CombatQ_trial.prc.

- HotSync your Palm OS palmtop with the desktop computer. Combat-Q will be installed on the palmtop and ready to run!

- Warning: do not install and run the trial version of Combat-Q if you already have the full version installed, or you will delete any data already entered into Combat-Q.

======================== REVISION HISTORY ========================
Version 1.0 - Initial release.

Version 1.1 - Minor feature upgrades and bug fixes.

Always display and allow editing of initiative check results on Overview screen, regardless of whether item is active or combat has started. Display initiative check results instead of initiative rolls on Roll Initiative screen.

Add hotkey ("F") for Refocus Character menu button on Play screen.

Numerous defect fixes, including one that made Combat-Q reset the system if the database became corrupt.

Version 1.2 - Add a minor feature and make compatible with Revised (v.3.5) System Reference Document.

New feature: allow editing character's or effect's name on the Current Combatant screen.

SRD change: Use initiative modifiers to break initiative check result ties.

SRD change: Allow Delay to set initiative to any later count, instead of to -10 or higher. Selecting "None" on Delay screen leaves initiative count the same; this lets you Delay into the next round without Refocusing.

SRD change: Replace Partial Actions with Move or Standard Actions.

SRD change: Add note to help screen that Refocus action is not in v.3.5, but keep the action for Dungeon Masters who want it as a house rule. 

SRD change: Update OGL.

Version 1.3 - Feature upgrades and minor bug fixes.

New feature: Add checkbox to characters to flag Player Characters. Between combats, PCs are sorted to the top of the overview list. The active checkbox of PCs is checked by default.

New feature: Allow effects to "Summon Creatures". Summoned creatures are just characters who leave combat when the effect that summoned them ends.

Bug fix: Cosmetic defect that appeare on Overview screen in Palm OS pre-v3.5 when adding characters.

Bug fix: Multiple pages on Enter Initiative Rolls screen sometimes displayed wrong character names.

Bug fix: Starting a second combat with a number of combatants that would fit on fewer pages of the Enter Initiative Rolls screen could cause a blank page to be displayed.

Future Versions "To Do" List - 

Allow undo of most recent change(s) to initiative list.
Add support for multiple campaigns.
Add feature to attach a text note to each character or effect.
Roll initiative for surprised characters *after* surprise round has been resolved. This is what the rules state in both the original and Revised SRDs. Currently initiative for all characters is rolled before any surprise round.

Known Bug - In Palm OS versions 3.0, 3.1, and 3.3, closing Combat-Q while the cursor is in any text field and a menu is open leaks memory (~80 bytes). Workarounds: close menus before exiting, periodically soft reset the device, or upgrade to Palm OS v3.5.

======================== TUTORIAL ========================

- Select the Combat-Q icon on the launcher screen.

- When "Initiative Overview" is at the top of the screen, click "New" to edit details about new character, then "Done" to create the character. Repeat to create a second character, because combat with only one is boring.

- Notice that the third column on the Overview screen shows initiative check results as if the characters had rolled 10's. You may edit these check results now if you like.

- Check the boxes next to each character. Click "Start" to start a combat.

- Grab a twenty-sided die and roll initiative for each character. Click on the name of each and enter what you rolled. Click "Start" again.

- Options for the current character will be displayed. Click "Take Action". Options for the next character are displayed. Click "Take Action" again. Round number increases by one and the first character is displayed again.

- Click "Create Effect" to edit details about a new continuing effect, like a spell, for the first character. Click "Take Action" twice to display how long the effect will remain. Click "Continue" to return to first character. Go through a few rounds until the effect expires.

- Perform a delaying action, where the first character delays until after the second character: When it is the first character's turn, click on "Delay Turn". Click on "None". The second character's options should be displayed. Click "Trigger Delayed Action" and select the first character. Click on "Take Action". The former first character's options will be displayed, but its initiative will be the same as the former second's and the round number will not change. Click "Take Action".

- Perform a readied action: Click on "Ready an Action". The next character's options will be displayed. Click on "Interrupt by Readied" and select the listed character. The readied character's options will be displayed. Click on "Take Standard or Move Action" to return to the next character.

- Remove another character from combat: Click on "Remove Other", and select the other character. Click on "Take Action". Round number will increase and the same character's options will reappear, because it is the only item left in the combat.

- Make a mistake? Select "Any" > "Overview" from the menu to display the Overview screen. You can edit initiatives here however you like.

- Explore the other options explained below or in the on-screen help.

4. Combat-Q Edit Character

SUMMARY:

Allows editing of a new or existing character. This is anything in the game that can take actions, like a player character, monster, or non-player character. Often, to simplify combat, several NPCs that act as a group should be treated as a single character in Combat-Q for purposes of initiative.

INPUTS:

"Name:" - The name of the character.

"Initiative Modifier:" - The number added to a character's initiative roll. May be positive or negative. Normally equal to dexterity modifier, with a +4 bonus for the Improved Initiative feat.

"'Spell' Number:" - This number is added to the end of the name of any effects the character creates. The number increases by one every time the character creates an effect. However, you may ignore this default name and name effects whatever you want.

"'Spell' Duration:" - The default duration of any effects the character creates. For spell-casting characters, you may want to set this to their caster level. You may set effects durations to whatever you want when they are created.

"Player Character" - Checking this box causes character to be above non-PC characters on the overview screen, when not in combat. Also, after a combat ends, character is automatically activated for the next combat. 

STATUS DISPLAYS:
You may not change these flags from this screen.

"Delaying" - Checked if the character is currently delaying.

"Readied" - Checked if the character is currently readied.

"Taking Readied Action" - Checked if the character is currently taking a readied action.

"Aware" - Checked if the character is aware of opponents. Always checked on round 1 and later.

BUTTONS:

"OK" - Accept the values entered and create or update the character. Return to previous screen.

"Delete" - Remove the character from the database. Return to previous screen.

"Cancel" - Make no changes and return to previous screen.

OTHER:

There is a Graffiti indicator in the lower right corner that shows current Graffiti shift status.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Combat-Q Edit Effect

SUMMARY:

Allows editing of a new or existing "continuing effect". This can be anything in the game that lasts for a limited time in combat, but does not take actions like a character. Examples include spells, barbarian rage, and stunning from a monk's stunning attack.

DISPLAYS:

"Owner:" - The character that created the effect, or "None", if the character has been deleted from the database.

INPUTS:

"Name:" - The name of the effect.

"Duration (Rounds):" - How long the effect normally lasts, in combat rounds.

"Rounds Remaining:" - How many more rounds the effect will last. This drops by one every time the effect's initiative value comes up while it is in combat. If the effect is added to a combat before the combat begins, this is set equal to Duration.

BUTTONS:

"Summon Creature" - Pops up a screen for editing a new character. This character will go after the effect's owner if the effect is new, otherwise the character will follow the effect. When the effect expires or is removed from combat, this character will leave combat too.

"OK" - Accept the values entered and create or update the effect. Return to previous screen.

"Delete" - Remove the effect from the database. Return to previous screen.

"Cancel" - Make no changes and return to previous screen.

OTHER:

There is a Graffiti indicator in the lower right corner that shows current Graffiti shift status.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Combat-Q Delaying

By choosing to delay, a character takes no action and then acts normally on whatever initiative count he or she decides to act. When a character delays, he or she voluntarily reduces his or her own initiative result for the rest of the combat. When the new, lower initiative count comes up later in the same round, the character can act normally. The character can specify this new initiative result (by entering a number and clicking "OK") or just wait until some time later in the round (by clicking "None"). On the turn of another character whom the delaying character wishes to follow, select "Trigger Delayed Action" and select the delaying character. This will fix the new initiative count of the delaying character at that point. 

To not delay, select "Cancel".
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Combat-Q Ties

One or both of the characters listed are entering combat, but they have the same initiative check results and initiative modifiers. Make initiative checks for both characters and click the button for the winner, rerolling ties.
