Combat-Q Roll Initiative

SUMMARY

Enter the d20 initiative rolls and surprise status of all characters starting a combat. Note: Combat-Q will add the character's initiative modifier to the roll number you enter to get the character's total initiative check result. Remember to enter the roll, not the total.

TABLE

"Name" Column - Name of the character. Click here or on "Result" to enter its initiative roll.

"Init" Column - Initiative check result of character. Click here or on "Name" to enter its initiative roll.

"Awr" (Aware) Column - Indicates whether the character is aware of opponents. Uncheck the box if the character is unaware or surprised. If some characters are aware and others are not, Combat-Q will start combat with a surprise round when only the aware characters may act.
