<p>Combat-Q keeps track of when characters get to act during combat, as well as when their spells expire. This lets the Dungeon Master play the game and not shuffle through papers looking up initiative check results. Never hear the cry "Hey, I think you skipped my turn!" from a player again! Easily keep track of what spells are in play. </p>
